# 🌐 JS-Learn — My Web Development Journey

Welcome to **JS-Learn**, a personal repository where I’m documenting my journey into **JavaScript** and **Web Development**! This space is dedicated to hands-on practice, experiments, and projects using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

This repo will grow as I learn, and it will include:

- ✨ **JavaScript practice files** – from basic syntax to DOM manipulation
- 🎨 **HTML & CSS templates** – small UI experiments and layout practice
- 🧪 **Mini projects** – combining HTML, CSS, and JS for fun, interactive components
- 📁 Well-organized folders and readable code

---

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

I created this as a **self-learning lab** to:

- Sharpen my JS skills by building real code
- Keep my progress organized
- Revisit and reflect on how far I’ve come
- Possibly help someone else starting out too!

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

## 📝 Note

This is a learning project. Code may evolve, change, or even break sometimes — and that's okay! 😊

Feel free to explore, give feedback, or just follow along as I learn.
